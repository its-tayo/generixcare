        <h3>Assessment - At Home</h3>
        <p>
          Our first point of action following receipt of referral information is to arrange a care
          needs assessment with you and your family at home. This allows us have a detailed
          conversation about your care requirements and how you want care delivered to suit your
          lifestyle. It also gives us an opportunity to match you with a suitable carer and
          determine what requirements need to be put in place to deliver care safely in your home.
          Although our assessments also involve your nearest and dearest, we expect final consent
          on all decisions to be given by you and we will only proceed with putting care package
          in place for you when we have explicit consent from you in writing.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>Assessment - Away From Home</h3>
        <p>
          If you are awaiting discharge from hospital or in a respite facility, we will arrange a
          visit with you in hospital or in the residential facility where you are being cared for
          as soon as we receive your referral information. This allows us we liaise with all
          health and care professionals who have looked after you to determine how best we
          collectively support your transition back home.
        </p>
        <p>
          We always follow up hospital visits with a family visit at home before your discharge,
          to allow us assess the suitability of your home provision to care provision; and more
          importantly ensure all necessary special equipment and support aids have been put in
          place for you before your return home. This allows us guarantee a smooth and sustainable
          return back to the place where you want to be. We discuss your medication with your GP,
          district nurse, community matron and community pharmacist to ensure you return home with
          the right medication with sufficient stock and make arrangements for ongoing delivery as
          required.

    title: 'Care Planning',

          All of the information we gather about you and your care needs and preferences is put into
          a care plan which is placed in your home file. This allows your carer have all of the
          information they need to support you at home. We will present you care plan to you and
          your family for written consent before we can start supporting you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your care plan will be reviewed with you on a regular basis and following any incidents to
          ensure it always meets your care needs as they change.

    html: `<p>
        Your regular carer will be introduced to you by your key worker who has conducted all of
        your assessments. Your key worker will attend the first few visits within the first week
        with your carer to ensure care provision progresses smoothly and your needs are met to
        your satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your key worker will remain the key link between your carer and the Care Management Team.
        Your key worker will from time to time call you on the phone and pop in for spot visits to
        check that you are happy with the quality of service you are receiving, deal with any
        queries or complaints, and assist you with any communication with your GP, nurse, social
        worker, etc.

    title: 'Funding Your Care',

    html: `<p>
    Here at GenerixCare, we understand that funding care provision at home is a significant
    concern for our customers and their families and care costs may inform important decisions
    around what type of care you choose to receive and how it is delivered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our promise to our clients is to always be upfront about home care costs and what to
    expect from our carers. Our clients can always expect a highly regulated and
    professionally managed care service. We are always more than happy to discuss the cost of
    home care with you and your loved ones, as well as the possibility of home care funding
    that may be available to you from the government.
  </p>
  <p>
    With self-funding clients, we offer flexible payment options when considering personal
    needs and your financial situation and encourage you to discuss these with our team during
    your assessment.
